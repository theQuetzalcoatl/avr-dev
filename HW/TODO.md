* [x] Make the corners round
* [x] Add version on silkscreen
* [x] Mark pin 1 of ICs with different pad than the others
* [x] Make all leds consume about 10-15 mA
* [x] Change pins of every button to fit into footprint
* [x] Low ohm resistors to the USART signals, to reduce possible crosstalk
* [-] Elongate the main MCU pads for easier soldering + easier removing of solder bridges.
* [x] Eliminate most of the  90Â° traces

---------------- v2.0 ----------------------

* [ ] Separate Arduino programmer from the board, only SPI connectrions shall remain
* [ ] Change the connector pinout to the USB/UART module to have it 5V
* [ ] Change position of C17,C9 and L1
* [ ] Use one resistor for Tx pin insted of R30 and R12
* [ ] Rotary encoder's case shall be grounded
* [ ] Led resistors to the back side
* [ ] Separate the analogue circuitries from each other.
