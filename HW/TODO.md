* [ ] Make the corners round
* [ ] Add version on silkscreen
* [ ] Mark pin 1 of ICs with different pad than the others
* [ ] Make all leds consume about 10-15 mA
* [ ] Change pins of every button to fit into footprint
* [ ] Low ohm resistors to the USART signals, to reduce possible crosstalk
* [ ] Elongate the main MCU pads for easier soldering + easier removing of solder bridges.
